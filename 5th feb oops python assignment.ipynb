    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This refers to the practice of combining data and methods within a single unit (class), and restricting access to the internal data of an object from the outside world, which helps to prevent accidental modification of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: This refers to the practice of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts by creating classes that define abstract concepts or behaviors, without specifying how those behaviors are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: This refers to the ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class (known as the parent or base class). This allows for the creation of more specialized classes by extending the functionality of existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they share a common interface. Polymorphism allows for more flexible and modular code, as it allows for the creation of generic code that can be reused with different types of objects."
